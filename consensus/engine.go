// Engine is the core struct that performs byzantine fault tolerant state
// machine replication using the Lock and Commit protocol.
//
// In order to function it depends on a networking implementation that completes
// the Gossip interface, a state machine for building, verifying, executing and
// persisting data and an optional signer which is necessary as a writer
// in the network to sign votes and proposals using a secured private key
//
// The engine runs only in memory and is thus not responsible for persistence and crash
// recovery. Each time start is called, a height and state machine is provided

	// namespace represents the unique id of the application. It is paired with
	// height and round to signal uniqueness of proposals and votes

	// gossip represents a simple networking abstraction for broadcasting messages
	// that should eventually propagate to all non-faulty nodes in the network as
	// well as eventually receiving all messages generated from other nodes.

	// as opposed to a reader or full node, in which case this can be nil.
